# Strength-Of-Symmetry

Local Symmetry Strength refers to the quantification of how symmetric a selected area of an image is. The goal of this repository is to create a 
function that returns a float value from 0 to 1 indicating the strength of symmetry on a specific bounding box. 1 for perfect symmetry, 0 for complete asymmetry. Multiple
symilarity metrics will be implemented and compared to check the symmetry of a specified area.
